    <h1>Fit Life</h1>
    <p>2018 was a very tough year for me. I had gone through a breakup and I was really struggling with my anxiety. School, Work, Family, and Money issues really took a toll on me.

    I felt like I experienced nearly everything in the image above. Struggling to find things that brought me happiness, a close friend suggested that I go to the gym. I already had a membership that I wasnt really utilizing it. I wasn't consistent at all and when I did go my routine consisted of cardio on the elliptical and what I thought was a full body workout using machines. </p>

    <p>My first day I walked into Daro's Extreme Fitness. It was a powerhouse gym. For those who may not know powerhouse gyms are usualy more grity with a lot of iron in sight. I felt a bit insecure and out of place but with guidance I was able to get through the day</p>

    <p>What followed after was the difficult part. I had to make time to go to the gym while managing being a full time student, having a part time job, and educating myself on nutrition and changing my diet. Even as I was incorporating the gym into my routine I was doubtful that I was able to keep this up. I was unsure if I was making enough progress. When I walked into Daro's I was about 223lbs. I was able to lose 10lbs after a few weeks but didnt really feel like it was noticiable. I learned that this process takes time. Keeping track of the food you eat and how it affects you takes time. I didnt see noticiable change until about 4 months into working out. My posture was better, my mood improved, and I didn't feel as tired as I did when I first started. The feeling of seeing my body change through the consistent hard work feels rewarding. At my peak I managed to lose 32lbs.I'll cap it here for now to say that anything you set your mind to you can achieve with planning, support, and most importantly believing you can do it.</p>
    
    <h2>Just How I did it?</h2>

    <p>30lbs is a lot of weight. Had I been asked if I see myself losing that much I probably wouldn't have believed it. Won't discuss my routine too much here but I felt like 3 day splits in addition to calisthenics has really been effective. I devided my days to legs, chest, and back. Keep in mind that the most important part to the gains occurs outside the gym. Without proper rest and nutrition you will not see the progress you are making. </p>
